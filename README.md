# Introduction

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

# Get started

By default, MarsCode runs the **start** script, but you can configure it by changing the configuration in the **.vscode/launch.json**. Refer to [Visual Studio Code's doc](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) for how to configure launch.json.
